### AccuRT_datagen_ozone.m
This is a code for simulation automatization. Most recently it has been used with AccuRT to create training data for my neural network.
A new, python version of this code is under way that will be way more flexible and will provide more adjustable options.

### NILU-data-process.ipynb
This is a python code to process raw data from the NILU-UV instrument that is deployed in Hoboken, NJ. The output file contains the following columns: 
SZA, CH5, CH3/CH1, yyyymmdd, doy, hhmm.  The ratio and the output chanels are easily adjustable.

### NeuralNetwork-predict.ipynb
This is a machine learning algorithm that was recently used to obtain total ozone column amounts from NILU-UV measurements.
